Welcome to the Investigate a Dataset project! Udacity ALX-T Data Analyst Nanodegree project 1. .

This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue. In this project we shall attempt to investigate which genres are most popular from year to year? What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues? Is there any popularity between budget and popularity.? Do popular movies translate to more revenue ?. Is there any relationship between vote count and revenue ?
